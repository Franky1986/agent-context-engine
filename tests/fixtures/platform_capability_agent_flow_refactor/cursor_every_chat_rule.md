# Project Instructions

`AGENTS.md` in this directory is the canonical instruction file for this project.

Cursor must use `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for:

- local Git rules
- safety rules for file operations
- Agent Context Engine lookup workflow
- linked workflow references
- commit behavior

Do not duplicate those rules here. If project instructions need to change, update `AGENTS.md`.

At the start of a chat, read `AGENTS.md` before loading deeper project context.
